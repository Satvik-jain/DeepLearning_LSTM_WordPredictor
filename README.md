# DeepLearning_LSTM_WordPredictor

This repository contains a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks designed for next word prediction. The model is capable of learning from a given text dataset and predicting the subsequent word in a sequence.

## Model Deployment

A trained model on "The Verdict (1908) by Edith Wharton" is deployed on Hugging Face, allowing for easy access.

### Access the Model

You can access the model directly on Hugging Face by clicking [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/satvikjain/The_verdict_text_generator).

## Features

- Implements LSTM for next word prediction.
- Capable of training on any text dataset.
- Includes scripts for preprocessing, training, and prediction.
