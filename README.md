# DeepLearning_LSTM_WordPredictor

This repository contains a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks designed for next word prediction. The model is capable of learning from a given text dataset and predicting the subsequent word in a sequence.

## Features

- Implements LSTM for next word prediction.
- Capable of training on any text dataset.
- Includes scripts for preprocessing, training, and prediction.

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains the text data used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Contains saved models and checkpoints.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and model training.
- `README.md`: Overview of the repository.
